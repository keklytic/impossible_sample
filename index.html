        <h2>Metaverse lands: A breakdown by Impossible Finance</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>by mcsauceth from Impossible Research 2021.12.02 </h5>
        <br>
        <p>Metaverse lands are becoming an increasingly popular digital asset class for both degen users and investors. Metaverses are the disruptive innovations to what we conventionally use to socialize, connect and earn in the online world. Projects these days are also implementing digital lands to achieve these objectives. Through either providing builds and experiences such as NFT galleries, games and digital events as a means of socializing, or providing increased monetization methods such as the ability to rent land or providing digital advertisements as a means of passive income.

            The rapid rise in both the quantity and price of Metaverse lands has taken the cryptocurrency space by storm, and Impossible Finance aims to help educate its community by providing the necessary knowledge of Metaverse lands and its offerings. In this report, we analyze in detail eight different metaverse lands projects, outlining both their quantitative and qualitative aspects for investment consideration. For each project, weâ€™ll analyze how land is being used (Land Utility), the floor marketcap, potential future collaborations, and our investment thesis.
            
            We hope this breakdown of Metaverse lands will provide the necessary information for readers to take their first step into the Metaverse!</p>
